# Prompt Management

## Introduction

This project is a web application that allows users to create and manage prompts for a prompt-based writing exercise. The application is built using [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) and the [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) framework, using [SkeletonUI](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started) as the GUI toolkit. It is based on a quick-and-dirty ChatGPT clone project called [SlickGPT](https://github.com/ShipBit/slickgpt).
